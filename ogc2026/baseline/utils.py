utils.py -- Bay/Block geometry and feasibility checking utilities

===============================================================================
PHYSICAL MODEL
===============================================================================

A *bay* is a rectangular storage area (width * height in integer grid units).
Each *block* occupies a region of the bay for a time interval
[entry_time, exit_time).  Blocks are loaded and unloaded by a vertical
overhead crane that moves exclusively in the vertical (z) direction: the crane
lowers a block straight down into the bay (ENTRY) and lifts it straight up out
of the bay (EXIT).  No horizontal repositioning during crane travel is allowed.

Block shape -- layers:
  Each block shape is described by one or more *layers*, indexed 0, 1, 2, ...
  A layer is a polygon in the 2-D (x, y) footprint plane.  Layer 0 represents
  the lowest physical level of the block; higher layer indices correspond to
  higher physical levels.  Multiple orientations of the same block are stored
  as separate entries in the "shape" list; orient_idx selects which one to use.

Crane-path geometry -- the j >= k rule:
  When the crane lowers a block, every layer k of the new block sweeps through
  all heights above its final resting level before coming to rest.  At descent
  offset d the new-block layer k occupies the same absolute height as
  existing-block layer (k + d).  Setting j = k + d gives j >= k.  Therefore:

    j == k : collision at the *final resting position* -- the two layers
             occupy the same height at the same time.
    j  > k : collision along the *descent path* -- new-block layer k passes
             through the height of existing-block layer j while still
             being lowered (sweep collision).

  The same j >= k rule applies symmetrically to crane exit (ascending motion).
  The condition j < k never causes a collision because in that case the
  existing layer j is *below* the descending new layer k and is never reached.

  Asymmetric layer counts:
    If the new block has more layers than the existing block (n_new > n_exist),
    the new block's upper layers (k >= n_exist) have no existing layer at or
    above them, so no collision check is needed for those layers.
    If the existing block has more layers (n_exist > n_new), those upper
    existing layers (j >= n_new) are fully checked for every new layer k,
    because the new block passes through those heights during descent.

===============================================================================
MAIN CLASSES
===============================================================================

Bay              : Rectangular bay dimensions and boundary helpers.
Block            : One block placed at (x, y) with a given orientation.
                   World-coordinate layer polygons are cached at construction.
CollisionResult  : Spatial overlap between two co-present blocks at one layer.
EntryObstruction : Crane-path obstruction when inserting or removing a block
                   (covers both final-position and sweep collisions).

===============================================================================
MAIN FUNCTIONS
===============================================================================

check_collisions(bay, blocks) -> list[CollisionResult]
    Spatial overlap check among all block pairs.  Uses AABB early-exit before
    full Shapely intersection.  Only layer k of block A vs layer k of block B
    is compared (same-height model).  Returns [] if no collisions.

check_entry(bay, blocks, new_block) -> list[EntryObstruction]
    Crane-entry feasibility: can the crane lower new_block into the bay without
    hitting any block in `blocks`?  Applies the j >= k descent-path rule.
    Also checks that new_block fits within the bay boundary.
    Returns [] if entry is feasible.

check_exit(bay, blocks, target_block) -> list[EntryObstruction]
    Crane-exit feasibility: can the crane lift target_block out of the bay
    without hitting surrounding blocks?  Same j >= k rule as check_entry.
    Returns [] if exit is feasible.

check_feasibility(prob_info, solution) -> dict
    Validates a complete solver solution through five ordered stages and
    computes the objective value if all stages pass.

    Check for spatial overlaps among all pairs of blocks at each layer.

    Two blocks "collide" when their polygons at the same layer index k have a
    non-zero intersection area.  This represents two objects physically occupying

    Algorithm:
      Step 1 -- AABB pre-filter: skip any block pair whose full-footprint
               bounding boxes do not overlap.  This eliminates most pairs in
               O(1) without invoking Shapely.

               shared layer index k.  Produces one CollisionResult per (pair,

    Layer count asymmetry:
      When two blocks have different numbers of layers, only layer indices 0
      through min(n_A, n_B) - 1 are compared.  The additional layers of the

@dataclass
class EntryObstruction:
    """
    A single crane-path obstruction encountered during block insertion or removal.

    Produced by check_entry (insertion) and check_exit (removal) when the
    crane's vertical travel path is blocked by an existing block.

    Attributes
    ----------
    existing_block : The block that causes the obstruction.
                     Special case: when existing_block.block_id == new_block.block_id
                     (self-reference), the obstruction indicates that new_block
                     exceeds the bay boundary rather than a collision with another
                     block.  Callers that need to distinguish boundary violations
                     from inter-block collisions should check this condition.
    new_layer      : Layer index k of the block being inserted/removed.
    exist_layer    : Layer index j of existing_block that causes the obstruction.
                     j >= k always holds (see module docstring for the j >= k rule).
    intersection   : Shapely geometry of the overlapping region between the two
                     layer polygons.  Useful for computing overlap area or
                     visualising where the obstruction occurs.
    area           : Area of the intersection polygon (auto-computed from
                     intersection in __post_init__).
    is_sweep       : True when j > k -- the obstruction occurs while the crane
                     is still moving (sweep/descent or ascent collision).
                     False when j == k -- the obstruction is at the final
                     resting position of the new block (same-height collision).

    """
    Check whether the crane can lower new_block into the bay without obstruction.

    Feasibility conditions:
      1. Bay boundary -- new_block must fit entirely within the bay.  If not,
         a sentinel EntryObstruction is returned with existing_block == new_block
         (self-reference) so callers can distinguish boundary violations from
         inter-block collisions.
      2. Final-position collision (j == k) -- layer k of new_block must not
         horizontally overlap layer k of any existing block.  Both layers would
         occupy the same physical height at the same time.
      3. Descent-path collision (j > k) -- while the crane lowers new_block by
         offset d = j - k, new-block layer k sweeps through the same absolute
         height as existing-block layer j.  Any horizontal overlap at this height
         blocks the descent.

    In summary, for each existing block, all (k, j) pairs with j >= k are checked
    for horizontal polygon overlap.  Pairs with j < k are never obstructing because
    the existing layer j would be below new-block layer k throughout descent.

    AABB pre-filter:
      For each existing block, the full-footprint bounding boxes are compared
      first.  If they do not overlap, no layer-level check is needed and the
      block is skipped entirely, avoiding all Shapely polygon construction.

    Layer count asymmetry:
      When new_block has more layers than an existing block (n_new > n_exist),
      new-block layers k >= n_exist have no existing layer at or above them
      (j >= k would require j >= n_exist, but the existing block has no such
      layers), so those new layers are never obstructed by that existing block.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bay       : Target bay for boundary checking.
    blocks    : Blocks already in the bay at the moment of insertion.
    new_block : Block being inserted.  x, y, orient_idx must be set to the
                intended placement position and orientation.
    fast      : If True, return immediately on the first obstruction found
                (useful when only presence/absence of obstruction matters,
                not the full list).

    Returns
    -------

    """
    Check whether the crane can lift target_block out of the bay without obstruction.

    The geometry is identical to check_entry: the j >= k rule applies in both
    directions because the crane moves purely vertically.  During ascent,
    target-block layer k sweeps through the height of surrounding-block layer j
    (j > k) in exactly the same way as during descent, just in the opposite
    direction.

    Feasibility conditions:
      1. Final-position collision (j == k) -- layer k of target_block must not
         currently overlap layer k of any surrounding block.  An existing
         overlap at the resting position means the crane cannot even start
         lifting.
      2. Ascent-path collision (j > k) -- while lifting target_block by offset
         d = j - k, target-block layer k sweeps through the height of
         surrounding-block layer j.  Any horizontal overlap at that height
         blocks the ascent.

    Self-exclusion:
      target_block itself may be included in `blocks` (e.g. when check_exit is
      called with the full list of blocks present in the bay).  It is
      automatically skipped by comparing block_id.  Callers do not need to
      remove target_block from the list before calling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bay          : Target bay (used for interface consistency; bay boundary is
                   not re-checked here since the block is already placed).
    blocks       : All blocks currently present in the bay, including
                   target_block itself (automatically excluded internally).
    target_block : The block to be removed by the crane.
    fast         : If True, return on the first obstruction found.

    """
    Construct a list of Block objects for blocks whose highest bay preference is bay_idx.

    This is a convenience helper for quick visual tests and unit tests.  It selects
    blocks by bay preference (mimicking the greedy algorithm's bay assignment),
    then places each block at a caller-supplied position or, if none is given, at an
    automatically computed grid position that avoids obvious overlaps.

    Block selection:
      A block is included iff  argmax(bay_preferences) == bay_idx.
      Blocks are returned in their original index order from instance["blocks"].

    Automatic grid placement (positions=None):
      The bounding box of orientation 0's first layer is used to estimate the block
      footprint.  Blocks are arranged left-to-right, top-to-bottom in columns of
      width (bw + 2), ensuring a 2-unit gap between adjacent blocks.  Positions are
      clamped to [0, bay_width - bw] * [0, bay_height - bh] to keep blocks inside
      the bay.  The grid layout does not guarantee collision-free placement; it is
      only intended to produce reasonable starting positions for visualisation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    instance       : Instance dict loaded from a problem instance JSON file.
    bay_idx        : Index of the target bay.  Only blocks preferring this bay

    positions      : Optional list of (x, y) integer positions, one per selected
                     block (in selection order).  If shorter than the block list,
                     auto-placement is used for the remaining blocks.
    orient_indices : Optional list of orient_idx values, one per selected block.

# check_feasibility -- solution validity check + objective computation
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

def check_feasibility(prob_info: dict, solution: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Validate a solution through five ordered stages and compute the objective.

    Stages are checked in sequence.  The first stage with any violation causes
    an immediate return; later stages are not evaluated.  This means the
    returned stage number is the *earliest* stage that fails, not necessarily
    the only one.

    -- Stage 1: assignment validity --------------------------------------------
    Every block in prob_info["blocks"] must appear in exactly one ENTRY
    operation and one EXIT operation.  Additionally:
      * bay_id must be in [0, n_bays).
      * orient_idx must be in [0, len(shape)).
      * entry_time >= release_time  (with 1e-6 tolerance for floating-point).
      * exit_time - entry_time >= processing_time  (same tolerance).
    A block_id appearing in more than one ENTRY or more than one EXIT operation
    is an immediate Stage-1 violation; no silent overwrite occurs.

    -- Stage 2: crane entry feasibility ----------------------------------------
    For each block's ENTRY event at time entry_time, check_entry is called with
    the set of blocks whose time intervals overlap entry_time:
      present_at_entry = { b : b.entry_time <= entry_time < b.exit_time }
    (Blocks whose exit_time equals entry_time have already left and are excluded
    by the strict upper bound.)

    -- Stage 3: crane exit feasibility -----------------------------------------
    For each block's EXIT event at time exit_time, check_exit is called with
    the set of blocks whose time intervals strictly span exit_time:
      present_at_exit = { b : b.entry_time < exit_time < b.exit_time }
      | { target_block itself }
    (The target block is always included; check_exit internally skips it.
    Blocks whose entry_time equals exit_time have not yet arrived.)

    -- Stage 4: spatial collision and boundary ----------------------------------
    For every pair of blocks (in the same bay) whose time intervals overlap,
    check_collisions is called to detect same-height polygon overlaps.  Also
    checks that every block lies within its bay boundary via contains_block.
    Time overlap uses the half-open interval model: [a, e) & [a', e') != {}
    iff a < e' and a' < e.

    -- Stage 5: sequential operation feasibility --------------------------------
    Operations are replayed in time order.  A bay_present set per bay tracks
    which blocks are currently in the bay.  At each time point:
      * All EXIT ops must precede all ENTRY ops (violation if an EXIT appears
        after any ENTRY at the same time point).
      * EXIT: the block must be in bay_present; check_exit is called against
        the current bay_present set.  On success the block is removed from
        bay_present.
      * ENTRY: check_entry is called against the current bay_present set.
        On success the block is added to bay_present.
    This stage is stricter than Stage 2/3 in detecting ordering violations
    within a time point, but more lenient for concurrent ENTRY/EXIT events
    because EXIT operations are processed first (removing blocks before new
    ones arrive).

    -- Objective computation (only when all stages pass) -----------------------
    obj1 = Sigma max(0, exit_time_i - due_date_i)          (total tardiness)
